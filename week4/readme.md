# Backpropagation Algorithm Implementation

## Introduction
Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. It's a key component in optimizing the weights of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

## Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the weights and biases of the neural network randomly or using predefined values.
2. **Forward Pass**: Perform a forward pass through the network:
    - Input the training data.
    - Compute the weighted sum of inputs and biases at each neuron in the network.
    - Apply an activation function to the weighted sum to obtain the output of each neuron.
    - Pass the outputs of each layer as inputs to the next layer.
3. **Error Computation**: Calculate the error between the predicted output and the actual output using a loss function.
4. **Backward Pass (Gradient Descent)**: Perform a backward pass through the network to update the weights and biases:
    - Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases using the chain rule of calculus.
    - Update the weights and biases in the direction that minimizes the error using gradient descent.
5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of iterations or until the error converges to a minimum threshold.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on validation or test data to assess its generalization ability.

## Activation Functions
Commonly used activation functions include:
- Sigmoid
- Hyperbolic tangent (tanh)
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Leaky ReLU
- Softmax (for output layer in multi-class classification)

## Loss Functions
Popular loss functions for different types of tasks include:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks
- Binary Cross-Entropy for binary classification tasks
- Categorical Cross-Entropy for multi-class classification tasks

## Regularization Techniques
To prevent overfitting, regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can be applied to the weights of the network.

## Optimization Algorithms
Various optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc., can be used to update the weights and biases efficiently during training.

## Application
Backpropagation is widely used in various applications including image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.
