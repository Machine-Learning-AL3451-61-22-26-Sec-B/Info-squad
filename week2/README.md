## ID3 Algorithm

1. **Functionality:**  
   This Streamlit application enables users to:
   - Upload a dataset
   - Train a Decision Tree Classifier using the ID3 algorithm
   - Visualize the decision tree
   - Make predictions on new samples

2. **Dataset Upload:**  
   Users can upload their dataset in CSV format through the sidebar.

3. **Decision Tree Visualization:**  
   Users can visualize the decision tree trained on the uploaded dataset.

4. **Prediction:**  
   Users can enter values for the features to predict the class label of a new sample.

5. **Accuracy Evaluation:**  
   The application displays the accuracy of the trained model on the test set.

6. **Repository Cloning:**  
   Clone this repository.

7. **Dependencies Installation:**  
   Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Required Dependencies:

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Dataset Format:

The uploaded dataset should be in CSV format, where each row represents an instance, and each column represents a feature or attribute. The last column should contain the class labels.
