ID3 ALGORITHM

1.	This Stream lit application allows users to upload a dataset, train a Decision Tree Classifier using the ID3 algorithm, visualize the decision tree, and make predictions on new samples.
2.	Dataset Upload: Users can upload their dataset in CSV format through the sidebar.
3.	Decision Tree Visualization: Users can visualize the decision tree trained on the uploaded dataset.
4.	Prediction: Users can enter values for the features to predict the class label of a new sample.
5.	Accuracy Evaluation: The application displays the accuracy of the trained model on the test set.
6.	Clone this repository
7.	Install the required dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt
8.	Run the Stream lit app: stream lit run app.py
9.	Navigate to the project directory:  cd decision-tree-classifier-app.
10.	Install the required Dependencies:  Stream lit, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.
11.	The uploaded dataset should be in CSV format, where each row represents an instance, and each column represents a feature or attribute. The last column should contain the class labels.
